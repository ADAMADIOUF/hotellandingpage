    text: '“The service at the Hotel Monteleone was exceptional. There was absolutely no issue that was not addressed timely and with satisfactory results. We were particulary impressed with how the hotel staff anticipated our needs (periodically coming by the Board Room to check with us). Numerous conference attendees commented on the quality of the food, the quality of the service and overall positive attitude toward the conference site. Particular noteworthy is the longevity of the staff and that sense of investment in the success of every event. I usually offer suggestions for improvements (part of being a marketing professor), but there is absolutely nothing that could be improved – you have set the bar very high.”',

    text: '“The hotel staff was beyond exceptional. During the past twenty years I have hosted hundreds of events at dozens of hotels and I can’t recall ever having things run as smoothly as they did for us at the Monteleone. We had very few “last minute changes” but those we had were handled flawlessly. The F&B quality and presentation was outstanding. We had numerous compliments from the attendees. On a personal note, I have stayed at 8 or 9 different hotels in New Orleans and can’t imagine staying anywhere other than the Monteleone from now on.”',
